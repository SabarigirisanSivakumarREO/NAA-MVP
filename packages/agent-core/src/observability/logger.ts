/**
 * Pino logger factory for Neural agent-core.
 *
 * Source: docs/specs/mvp/architecture.md §6.4 (logging stack);
 *         docs/specs/mvp/PRD.md §10 (R6 channel 1 — Pino redaction);
 *         docs/specs/mvp/phases/phase-1-perception/spec.md §line 110
 *           (Phase 1 correlation fields).
 *
 * # Correlation field convention
 *
 * Callers attach correlation context via `pino`'s `child(bindings)` API.
 * The `LogBindings` interface below ENUMERATES the canonical field names
 * the codebase uses today; new fields should be added here first (with a
 * REQ-ID / phase reference) before being adopted by callers, so the
 * registry in this file stays the single source of truth.
 *
 * Phase 0 (orchestrator) fields:
 *   - `audit_run_id` — uuid; one per pipeline invocation.
 *   - `node_name`    — orchestrator node currently executing.
 *
 * Phase 1 (perception) fields (spec.md §line 110):
 *   - `session_id`   — uuid attached at BrowserSession scope (BrowserManager.ts).
 *   - `page_url`     — URL after `page.goto()` resolves (ContextAssembler.ts).
 *   - `extractor`    — name of the extractor currently running, e.g.
 *                      `accessibility`, `mutation`, `screenshot`. (Encoded
 *                      today via the logger `name` channel — e.g.
 *                      `createLogger('accessibility-extractor')` — and
 *                      reserved here for future explicit child-binding use
 *                      when an extractor needs sub-step correlation.)
 *
 * Future phases will extend `LogBindings` with their own correlation
 * fields (e.g. `heuristic_id`, `trace_id`) per the same convention.
 *
 * # Implementation notes
 *
 * Why `base: null` (Pino API): correlation fields supply identity; pid is
 * leaky across container restarts (R14 reproducibility) and noisy in logs.
 *
 * Why two `pino()` call sites instead of conditional-spread `transport`:
 * tsconfig.json sets `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` (R2.x strictness),
 * which forbids assigning `undefined` to optional properties even via
 * spread; the explicit branch keeps Pino's discriminated-union types clean.
 *
 * Why `LogBindings` is `Partial<...>` not strict: pino's `child()` accepts
 * arbitrary `Bindings`; this interface is documentation + author-time
 * type discipline, not a runtime gate. Callers may pass a subset.
